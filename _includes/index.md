Hi - thanks for checking out my page! I'm Jai Govindani, an entrepreneur and iOS developer currently residing in Bangkok, Thailand. If I haven't been lazy, there should be a list of social media profile links somewhere on this page that you can use to get to know me better if you're so inclined.

I've made this page to highlight my open source contributions and stuff I'm working on. I'd also like to add a page of libraries I use at some point - a lot of people have done a lot of great work that's saved me a lot of time and I owe it to them to highlight their contributions.

### Some of my work

[Foundation Safety](https://github.com/jai/FoundationSafety)
is a collection of simple-ish safety methods implemented as categories on NSArray/NSMutableArray and NSDictionary/NSMutableDictionary. I did this mostly to save myself from crashing my app everytime the server returned JSON in an inconsistent format. It's all pod'ded and ready for use.

[UIButton+StatefulBackgroundColor](https://github.com/jai/UIButton-StatefulBackgroundColor) is a simple category on UIButton that adds a `setBackgroundColor:forState:` method which does exactly what you'd think it does. Not sure why Apple left this out of the `UIButton` APIs but oh well. There's still a slight bug with re-using buttons but you're welcome to have a go at it!

### Libraries I use

** Coming Soon! **

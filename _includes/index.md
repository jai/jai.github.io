Hey - welcome to my Github page. Hasn't been updated in a while, and maybe not for a much longer :)

I'm Jai - most recently CTO @ Honest Bank (https://honestbank.com/), previously @RedPlanetHotels. I like building companies and products. I also enjoy running, skydiving, reading, eating, being with people and lots of other things.

There's some code here I've played with. I have some on Bitbucket too - will link to it at some point once it's worthwhile.

Feel free to reach out if you're up for a drink! I can usually be found in Bangkok, California, Amsterdam, Spain or...well just reach out and I'll let you know :)

== WARNING - OLD STUFF ==

### Some of my work

[BVViewList](https://github.com/Bogidon/BVViewList) - so I've taken to stalking the iOS developers of the places where I've applied for a job. Found one of them had [requested a feature](https://github.com/Bogidon/BVViewList/issues/1) so I went ahead and [implemented it](https://github.com/Bogidon/BVViewList/pull/5). Hope it impresses ;)

UPDATE: I've also introduced some bugs (as new features are wont to do) but I'm fixing them!

[VideoMerge](https://github.com/jai/VideoMerge) - my learner Swift project. I'm using it to get the hang of Swift and interacting with ObjC APIs with it. If it matures into something else I'll end up changing the name but for the next few days it'll just be called VideoMerge :)

[ZProgressView](https://github.com/zodio/ZProgressView) is a progress view that supports adding 'stops' or markers that can indicate a minimum progress. I created this for the video recording functionality in the [Zodio iPhone app](http://i.zodio.com) to indicate a minimum recording duration. Small and simple, does one thing and does it well - exactly what a good lib should do, in my opinion!

[AFS3Client](https://github.com/jai/AFS3Client) is a simple HTTP PUT client for Amazon S3's REST API. I didn't write the lib but I've been improving upon it. These signed requests are non-trivial to create and if you're just starting out with the S3 REST API, this is definitely the way to go. I still need to improve it to add support for POST and GET, or feel free to submit a pull request!

[Foundation Safety](https://github.com/jai/FoundationSafety)
is a collection of simple-ish safety methods implemented as categories on NSArray/NSMutableArray and NSDictionary/NSMutableDictionary. I did this mostly to save myself from crashing my app everytime the server returned JSON in an inconsistent format. It's all pod'ded and ready for use.

[UIButton+StatefulBackgroundColor](https://github.com/jai/UIButton-StatefulBackgroundColor) is a simple category on UIButton that adds a `setBackgroundColor:forState:` method which does exactly what you'd think it does. Not sure why Apple left this out of the `UIButton` APIs but oh well. There's still a slight bug with re-using buttons but you're welcome to have a go at it!

### Libraries I use

** Coming Soon! **
